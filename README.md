## Overview

The Open Banking reference app is a sample app to [Mastercard's Open Banking APIs](https://developer.mastercard.com/product/open-banking/) where users can explore examples of how Connect and other APIs can be implemented into their applications. The reference app will allow you to create test customers and also seek permission to access test account data from one or more of their test accounts. Please note that applications accessing the Open Banking APIs must be hosted within the United States.

### Compatibility

-   **Node (v14+)**
-   **ReactJS (v18.2.21)**

This application is built using the ReactJS framework. ReactJS requires Node version 14+.
However, It is recommended that you use one of NodeJS's LTS releases or one of the [more general recent releases](https://github.com/nodejs/Release). A Node version manager such as [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (Mac and Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) can help with this.

### Installation

Before using the open banking reference application, you will need to set up a project in the local machine.
The following commands will help you to get the latest code and install the required dependencies on your machine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Mastercard/open-banking-reference-application.git
```

```shell
cd open-banking-reference-application && npm i

### 2. Add credentials in the .env file

Open banking reference application needs Sandbox API credentials added in the .env file to make the API calls.

## Steps to be performed for creating application build

This step is required only when the application needs to be deployed on the server.

Run the following command to create the application build.

```
npm run build
```

Refer to the below code snippet for creating an [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) application.
In addition to that we are using [http-proxy-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-middleware) for handling proxy requests to open banking APIs or you can set up your proxy server for managing CORS (cross-origin-resource-sharing).

```
const express = require('express');
const {createProxyMiddleware} = require('http-proxy-middleware');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 4000;

app.use(express.static('build'));
app.use(
    ['/aggregation/**', '/connect/**'],
    createProxyMiddleware({
      target: 'https://api.finicity.com',
      changeOrigin: true,
    })
  );
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
});
```
